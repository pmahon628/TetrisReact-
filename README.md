# TetrisReact-
The classic tetris game built in React via freecodecamp tutorial.

This is my first time using a few different things in react that I have not before.
1. - All the styles are done using JavaScript - see the styles folder
2. - Hooks. I had not used them before but now I plan on using them more often as they are very useful.

To Run:
1. - Clone Repo
2. - run npm install.
3.  - run command npm start in the terminal.
4. - use your arrow keys to move tetris blocks.
3. Enjoy! - not much to say here, its tetris!  

Oh right, how to play?  Use your arrow keys, -  > down makes the blocks fall faster and up changes their direction while the left and right move the blocks from side to side.
