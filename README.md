# TetrisReact-
The classic tetris game built in React via freecodecamp tutorial.

This is my first time using a few different things in react that I have not before.
1. - All the styles are done using JavaScript - see the styles folder
2. - Hooks. I had not used them before but now I plan on using them more often as they are very useful.

To Run:
1. - Clone Repo
2. - run npm install.
3. Enjoy! - not much to say here, its tetris!
